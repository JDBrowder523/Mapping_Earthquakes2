# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview

 The purpose of this project was to use GeoJSON data to a visualize earthquake data in the past 7 days from around the world.  Leaflet and the d3 library were used to add base layers, tile layers, and earthquake data to a map of the Earth.
 The earthquake data is displayed as circle markers with colors corresponding to their magnitudes.  The markers also display a popup that displays the magnitude and the relative location of each earthquake.  The map can be displayed as a street map, a satellite map, and a dark map.  The three layers- all earthquake data, tectonic plate lines, and major earthquakes-can all be toggled on and off.
